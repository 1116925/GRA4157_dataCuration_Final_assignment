This repo holds a more concecise folder with a jupyter notebook and seperate python scripts that hold the core functions necessary for the notebook to run neatly.

This project was originally developed in the Deepnote platform, a colaborative online workspace akin to a Jupyter notebook but hosted entierly cloud. You can see the original graphs and tables in the app through the link https://deepnote.com/app/data-curation/Eurostat-data-gathering-script-37c198e5-2d9d-4d28-8044-4b6f490ea356?utm_source=share-modal&utm_medium=product-shared-content&utm_campaign=data-app&utm_content=37c198e5-2d9d-4d28-8044-4b6f490ea356
Note that to enter the app, it is most likely necessary to create an account. For this perpose all the code has also been converted into the code in this repo
